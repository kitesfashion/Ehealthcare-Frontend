Here, a group of experienced pathologists, PhD scientists & clinicians work together to ensure quality report with proper clinical relevance. Until we started, lots of lab investigations were being outsourced to foreign labs causing communication gap or delay in service. We introduced many uncommon investigations not available in your neighborhood lab and we set the trend of early reporting on advanced blood tests. By virtue of our specialized services, we're relevant to all sections of society including general citizens, medical institutions, corporates and research organizations. Our services are useful in diagnosing deep-set disorders related to child growth, debility, sleep, sex, weight, mood swings, stress etc. Our extensive Quality Assurance Program ensures services that match global standards. As a mid-size set-up, with all our focus only on lab services, you can expect best of care from us.</p>
